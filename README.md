# Sysmon Blue Team Lab üõ°Ô∏è

This repository serves as a **laboratory** to showcase my skills in **security monitoring** using **Sysmon** on Windows systems. In this lab, I will walk you through the installation of Sysmon, configuring it using the recommended **SwiftOnSecurity's Sysmon Config**, and performing basic analysis to detect suspicious activities.

## **Introduction** üéØ

**Sysmon** (System Monitor) is a powerful Windows system service and device driver developed by Microsoft‚Äôs Sysinternals suite. It provides detailed information about system activity, which can be used for detecting malicious behavior, performing incident response, and creating a comprehensive security monitoring setup.

In this lab, we will be setting up Sysmon with the configuration file recommended by **SwiftOnSecurity** to monitor various system events such as process creations, network connections, file modifications, and registry changes. This configuration helps to identify suspicious or anomalous activities that might indicate a cyber attack.

## **Prerequisites** ‚öôÔ∏è

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Windows OS** (Windows 10 or Server 2016 and above)
- **Sysmon** (downloadable from the Sysinternals suite)
- **SwiftOnSecurity's Sysmon Config**: This is the configuration file we will use, which is designed for security monitoring.
- Administrator privileges üîë
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity and security monitoring principles üîç

## **Step 1: Download and Install Sysmon** üì•

Follow these steps to download and install Sysmon:

1. **Download Sysmon** from the official [Sysinternals website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
2. **Extract** the downloaded zip file to a location on your machine.
3. **Open PowerShell as Administrator** and navigate to the Sysmon folder.

## Step 2: Configure Sysmon Using SwiftOnSecurity's Sysmon Config ‚öôÔ∏è

The SwiftOnSecurity GitHub repository provides a community-vetted sysmonconfig.xml that‚Äôs designed to monitor key system activities like process creation, network connections, file changes, and registry modifications. This configuration is ideal for detecting malicious activities on Windows systems.

Visit the official SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon Config repository: https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config

Download the latest sysmonconfig.xml file from the repository and save it in your Sysmon folder (where you extracted Sysmon).

The following command will install the system, with the configuration file
```powershell
    sysmon -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml
```
After installation, verify that Sysmon is running by checking the Event Viewer for Sysmon logs:
```powershell
    Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational
```
You should see events for process creation, network connections, and other monitored activities.

## Step 3: Detecting a Suspicious Process Masquerading as svchost.exe üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In this step, we simulate a scenario where an attacker attempts to run a malicious process that disguises itself as a legitimate Windows service ‚Äî svchost.exe. This is a common technique used in malware to avoid detection by security tools.
Scenario: Process Masquerading with Python

The attacker executes a Python script that launches a process with the name svchost.exe. Although the process name appears legitimate, its location and behavior are not consistent with the real Windows svchost.exe.
Simulation:

We use a custom Python script to simulate this behavior:
```powershell
python svchost.py
```
Make sure the script runs a child process with the image name svchost.exe from a non-standard directory (e.g., user's Downloads or Desktop).

Sysmon Detection:

Once the fake svchost.exe is executed, Sysmon will log the process creation and image load events.

1Ô∏è‚É£ View Process Creation (Event ID 1):

Open Event Viewer:
```nginx
Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational
```
Filter for Event ID 1, and look for suspicious details such as:

. Image Path: The real svchost.exe should be in C:\Windows\System32. If it runs from Downloads, it's likely malicious.

. Parent Process: A legitimate svchost.exe is usually started by services.exe. If you see python.exe or another unusual parent, it's suspicious.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Look for Additional Events:

. Event ID 7 - Image loaded (DLLs)

. Event ID 11 - File created (if the script creates files)

. Event ID 3 - Network connection (if the process connects to internet)

Example Event Highlights:
```plaintext
Image: C:\Users\User\Downloads\svchost.exe
ParentImage: C:\Python311\python.exe
CommandLine: "C:\Users\User\Downloads\svchost.exe"
```
This behavior should raise red flags, as it imitates a critical Windows process but originates from a user directory.
