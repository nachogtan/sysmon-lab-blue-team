## Introduction
This project aims to explore the power of Sysmon logs and how they can help uncover meaningful information from suspicious artifacts.

## üîç Detection
As part of a routine system check, I discovered a file named **svchost.exe** located in the Downloads folder. This immediately raised a red flag. Normally, this executable should not reside in that location.

As a reminder, Service Host (svchost.exe) is a critical **system process** in Windows that acts as a generic host for services running from DLL files. These services are grouped by function and run in separate instances of the Service Host process. The legitimate svchost.exe is typically located in C:\Windows\System32\, so finding it elsewhere is a strong indicator of compromise (IoC).

To investigate further, I used PowerShell to query Sysmon logs and search for any svchost.exe executions occurring outside of the expected directory:
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*svchost.exe*" -and $_.Message -notlike "*System32*" }
```
This query returned several events involving the creation and termination of a process named svchost.exe, which, notably, did not originate from the System32 directory:
```plaintext
ProviderName: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon

TimeCreated                      Id LevelDisplayName Message
-----------                      -- ---------------- -------
11/04/2025 16:15:44               5 Information      Process terminated:...
11/04/2025 16:15:34               1 Information      Process Create:...
11/04/2025 16:15:34              11 Information      File created:...
11/04/2025 16:15:01               5 Information      Process terminated:...
11/04/2025 16:14:51               1 Information      Process Create:...
11/04/2025 16:14:50              11 Information      File created:...
```
This confirmed that a suspicious instance of svchost.exe had been executed outside of its legitimate path.

## File Metadata Analysis
The metadata of the suspicious file also provided valuable insight. By examining the creation date and time of the file, I was able to correlate it with the Sysmon event logs. The file creation timestamp matched the time frame when the suspicious process was initiated, reinforcing the suspicion that this might be an unauthorized or malicious process.

## Sysmon Logs
Based on the creation date and time of the suspicious svchost.exe file, I narrowed down my search within Event Viewer (specifically the Sysmon logs). This allowed me to focus on a precise time window and correlate relevant events more effectively.

During this time frame, multiple Process Create (Event ID 1) and File Creation (Event ID 11) events were recorded, all related to the svchost.exe located in the Downloads folder.

Upon further inspection of these logs, it became evident that the image path and the parent process were inconsistent with what we would expect from a legitimate svchost.exe execution. Additionally, neither the process itself nor its parent were digitally signed by Microsoft, which further increased the suspicion.

## sha256 Hash Comparison
As an additional verification step, I compared the sha256 hash of the suspicious file with that of the legitimate svchost.exe. The mismatch in hashes confirmed they were not the same binary:
```plaintext
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> CertUtil -hashfile C:\Users\Ignacio\Downloads\svchost.exe sha256
SHA256 hash of C:\Users\Ignacio\Downloads\svchost.exe:
6eef334d826be3dc737bb30fbe84b69e529aab956ec33d714b5a75276a58ed04
```
```plaintext
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> CertUtil -hashfile C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe sha256
SHA256 hash of C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe:
324451797ac909a4dd40c7a2f7347ef91f6b7c786941ad5035f609c0fc15edaa
```
## Schedules and Registry
I checked the Windows Task Scheduler and the Run registry entries in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run for any programs configured to run automatically at boot time. This could include malicious persistence mechanisms that would allow the compromised svchost.exe to restart even after deletion.

## Recap and findings
After a file named svchost.exe was detected in the downloads folder, I began a thorough investigation to understand its origin and potential.
Using a combination of different tools like PowerShell, Sysmon, and Registry Editor, I found that:
- The svchost.exe process, located in the Downloads folder, is not legitimate. The legitimate process resides in C:\Windows\System32, and one of its parent processes is services.exe. In the case of our suspicious file, it's located in C:\Users\Ignacio\Downloads, and its parent process is python.exe.
- A sha256 file comparison shows that this file is different from the original Windows file.
- The Registry Editor indicates that no processes related to svchost.exe are active and running or scheduled to start at boot time.
- The aforementioned analysis suggests that this file was a malicious Python script masquerading as a legitimate system process. I couldn't find any traces of code execution or related processes.
- It is suggested to quarantine the file and performing an extensive analysis to identify its source and adjust the firewall rules accordingly.

### * As a future improvement, the script could be extended to send real-time email alerts using PowerShell's Send-MailMessage command and SMTP authentication.
